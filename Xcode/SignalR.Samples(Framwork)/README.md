# SignalR.Samples Xcode Project

## What is this for?
This project is meant to be a proof of concept, it is by no means production ready. 

## How to use
Each sample in the iPad app allows for a server to be entered.  It is assumed that you have already setup an ASP.NET project that is hosting a project that uses the SignalR.Samples Project

## How you can help?
Update these samples either within this project or as their own standalone projects to more closely match the ones on in the SignalR Project
