# SignalR 
Async signaling library for ASP.NET to help build real-time, multi-user interactive web applications
for the official SignalR Library for ASP.NET see the [SignalR Repository](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki)

# SignalR Objective-C
Extends the reach of the main SignalR project by providing a client that is written in Objective-C and is compaitible
with iOS and Mac

## What can it be used for?
Pushing data from the server to the client (not just browser clients) has always been a tough problem. SignalR makes 
it dead easy and handles all the heavy lifting for you.
